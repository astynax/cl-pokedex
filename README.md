# CL-Pokedex

A simple showcase WebApp that I have made in the process of learning the Common Lisp ecosystem.

The app is simple: one can browse a long list of [Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon) and get some info about any of them.

My CSS/HTML skills are pretty basic. That's why I styled this app with awesome [blocks.css](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/).
